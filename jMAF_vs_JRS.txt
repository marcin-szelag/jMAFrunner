Obsolete features of jMAF (w.r.t. develop version of jRS):

a) CONSISTENCY_IN_POS as default setting for consistencyIn switch
b) only border examples in approximations for VC-DRSA (VCDomLem.getModeOfPositiveExamplesForVCDRSA() == ALL_DIFFERENT_BORDER_POSITIVE_EXAMPLES),
   both in standard and monotonic version
c) missing values not handled (due to  a) and b))
d) even for data without missing values, jMAF does not handle combination: 1.0 possible monotonic
   (Exception: Approximated entity number 0 is not compatible with VC-DOMLEM implementation.)
e) existing error in implementation of VC-DomLEM algorithm concerning initialization of rule's statistics (without respecting consistencyIn switch);
  this bug was corrected only in commit bc78e14689bc3cd64c202993e402151b54e5f2e8,
  but it does not affect jMAF because in jMAF there is: VCDomLEM.DEFAULT_CONSISTENCY_IN = RuleConstants.CONSISTENCY_IN_POS
f) c1-ConfirmationMeasure rule statistic not written to *.rules file
